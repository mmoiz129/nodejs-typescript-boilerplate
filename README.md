# Nodejs, Typescript and Mysql 
The goal is to implement an api for an application to manage working tasks. See the __[user stories](#user-stories)__ for the application details to be implemented.

# To Run Application
* To run the application please perform following task 
    * Create database in mysql
    * Change username, password and database name in ormconfig.json
    * npm install to install all dependencies
    * **npm run migration** to run migrations
    * **npm run start** to run application 

# User stories
* As a user I can create tasks, so that all tasks for a project can be tracked.
  * Acceptance Criteria:
  * A task must have a title
  * A task must have a long description
  * A task must have the status "ToDo"
  * A task must have the user who created it
  * A task must have the date and time when it was created
* As a user I can change the status of a Task, so that the progress of the project can be tracked.
  * Acceptance Criteria:
  * A task must have the user who updated it
  * A task must have the date and time when it was updated
  * Only the following status transitions are allowed, see __[state transitions](#state-transitions)__
* As a user I can change the title and long description of a task.
* As a user I can assign a task to another user, so that the responsibility of a task can be visualized.
* As a user I will see the history of a Task, so that I can track the history of a task.
  * Acceptance Criteria:
  * The user of a change must be tracked
  * The date and time of a change must be tracked
  * The previous and the next value of a change must be tracked
